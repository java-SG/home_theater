# home_theater
<--- SHORT INTRO & DISCLAIMER --->
This project will encompass a build for setting up a Home theater web app, the eventual goal is to make it able to run completely offline (Detaching from IMDB Database sourced data).
Under no circumstances will this project be used for public release, let alone any form of monetized purposes.
It is purely for educational purposes and to work out my own creative skills on building web applications.

[ ] Login with UUID backend validation with persisted frontend storage (session & local)
[ ] Load and display available media content (Movies, Series & Music)
