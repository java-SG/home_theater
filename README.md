# home_theater
<--- SHORT INTRO & DISCLAIMER ---><br>
This project will encompass a build for setting up a Home theater web app, the eventual goal is to make it able to run completely offline (Detaching from IMDB Database sourced data).<br>
Under no circumstances will this project be used for public release, let alone any form of monetized purposes.<br>
It is purely for educational purposes and to work out my own creative skills on building web applications.<br>
